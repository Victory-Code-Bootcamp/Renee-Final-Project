    <h1>A little about me</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Renee. I am a highly motivated self starter whom is excited to
      pursue a new career path in web development. I was born in Roswell, N.M.
      and moved to Washington at age 15. At age 17 I enrolled in Job Corps and
      pursued a career in welding. This was interrupted when I was arrested and
      sentenced to 140 months in prison. While incarcerated, I focused my time
      on self development and enrolled in educational courses and self help
      classes. About 6 years after going to prison, I finally had the courage to
      be true to who I am. I came out as a trans female and am glad I did. I
      finished my time by building a network of individuals whom would help my
      transition back to the community go a bit smoother. Post incarceration I
      landed a job I held until my revokation in '22.
    </p>
    <p>
      What brought me to Victory Code was a desire to be challenged and a desire
      to pursue another career path. I have been incarcerated most of my adult
      life and that has left me scrambling to build a decent retirement for
      myself. Because I have started so late in life, I am looking to preserve
      my body by learning a skill which not only brings a higher level of pay,
      but also is easier on the body. I can't get excited about growing old and
      not be comfortable due to the abuse I would have put myself through in a
      manual labor industry. I hope to achieve a deep understanding of coding
      that I can tap into and use to build a nice retirement for myself. And
      have some fun with the challenges I am about to face
    </p>
